# MinecraftNativesDownloader - Generate Minecraft Natives Especially for Unsupported Platforms.

# Description

This is a tool to generate Minecraft Natives especially for unsupported platforms.

Why use native libraries? Even with powerful Rosetta 2, running Minecraft on Apple Silicon is still slow. Using native libraries can improve the performance of Minecraft on Apple Silicon.
